### Project Template

### AnkiSound

### Pitch
Ankisound is a decentralized langauge learning app designed for students who used space repetation software (SRS), specifically the most popular, Anki, to allow the customization and flexiblity that an audio focused program would allow without the cost, hassle or restrictions of a typical language learning system.  Essentially cusomized Pimsleur flashcards using the Fluent Forever learning system and the latest in Machine Learning audio technology.

### Problem
Everyone wants to be fluent in another language and the best way to do so is through an audio focused program yet they cost thousands of dollars, haven't been updated in decades and are very restrictive in their use (say trying to learn Ecuadorian Spanish, which is very different from the Spanish taught in most courses).  Everyone is capabile of learning many languages quicky, the problem is usually the process.  The current process is boring, not relevant to the speaker and doesn't produce results quickly enough to make the pain of learning feel worth it.  

### Solution
The solution to this problem is by creating a customized solution for each language student using the latest in SRS and audio technology.  Ankisound combines the latest in Space Repetition System technology combined with user selected words and sentences using Machine Learning technology that simulates a real speaker to allow custom user genereated audio files to be used in a SRS, like Anki. Each student can create their personalized system that produces results.  

### Target Audience
The target audience is self-motivated langauge learners with basic computer skills.  Anki is the most popular SRS program and using Anki in AnkiSound will help drive people to the app.  This app would also be helpful for industries that have DSL such as medical students or clergy.  

### New Techniques

This project will be built using React and if I have to build a backend (which I think I can get around) I will attempt to use Golang with Node as a backup.  This will also use the AWS voice API to access the audio files.  If AWS doesn't work I plan on using Google's Cloud Voice API.  

### Workflow
Waffle

### WorstCase
Although I have already talked to the instructors about this idea and have a soft approval if this is too challenging with so many new concepts I also think I could build a Bitcoin wallet using Golang but I would like to learn React (maybe I could build it in React too) or a system that verifys honorable military service for ecommerce sites (I think this would be very profitable).
